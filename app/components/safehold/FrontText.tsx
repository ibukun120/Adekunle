        Brief Description of Safehold Escrow
      </h1>
      <p className="mb-10">
        Safehold Escrow is a secure transaction platform built to eliminate
        distrust in online buying and selling across Nigeria and emerging
        markets. It provides a safe middle-layer that holds funds until both
        parties fulfill their obligations, ensuring trust, transparency, and
        fairness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mission was to design an MVP that makes secure transactions simple,
        intuitive, and reliable, even for users who have never used escrow
        before.
