          Problem Statement
        </h1>
        <p className="leading-7">
          In Nigeria, many people face fragmented financial services, high
          transaction costs, and lack of visibility across their accounts. These
          challenges make it harder to save, budget, and invest wisely. Peakwise
          saw an opportunity to bring all financial needs into one
          platform—helping users make smarter decisions with ease.

        <h1 className="text-[#005C10] text-2xl font-semibold">The Vision:</h1>
        <p className="leading-7">
          Peakwise is more than a finance company. They are a mission-driven
          team committed to helping individuals and businesses unlock their
          financial potential.

          <p>They set out to:</p>
          <p>Aggregate multiple bank accounts into one view.</p>

          <p>Build trust through security, transparency, and education.</p>
          <p>
            To communicate this mission, they needed a website that told a
            compelling story, connected with users emotionally and practically,
            and reflected their innovative personality.
