        The SapphireCredit logo has been thoughtfully crafted to reflect the
        brand’s modern, bold, and trustworthy personality. The clean and
        distinctive logotype is designed to be instantly recognizable and
        resonate with a digital-first audience.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-8 text-black">
        To ensure brand consistency across all communications, the full logotype
        should primarily be displayed in Sapphire Blue (#0F52BA), with
        supporting primary brand colours including Robin Blue (#00C2CB), Non
        Photo Blue (#98DFEA), and Web Orange (#FFAF46). These colours work
        together to create a vibrant, trustworthy, and innovative visual
        identity across all touch points.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-8 text-black">
        It is essential that the logo’s typography, structure, and spacing
        remain unchanged. The logotype must not be retyped, modified, stretched,
        or altered in any way. Preserving its integrity ensures strong and
        consistent brand recognition across all platforms.
